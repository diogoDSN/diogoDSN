## Diogo Nogueira

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate student at Instituto Superior Técnico. I focused on ML for my master’s and studied for six months abroad at TUM. I’m currently working on my thesis with a focus on RL and I’m always up for new challenges and projects. In my free time, I’m either tinkering with my home server or traveling around Europe. You'll find some of my most pollished projects on this profile.

Currently, I'm working on my personal website, if it's up you'll find it [here](https://dev-notes.diogosnogueira.com).
